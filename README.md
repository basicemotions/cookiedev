As we’re working on customer projects, we can’t show the code (all IPs below to our customers), yet we wanted to take this change to introduce ourselves. 

Please find below the link to some of the projects we've done (yet the most exciting ones are not listed due to NDA): https://cookiedev.com/portfolio/

Our main expertise areas include:
- Marketplace apps: https://cookiedev.com/our_expertise/marketplaces_projects/

- and much more

Following are also the key points about working with us I'd want to highlight:
0) You pay ONLY for the actual developers' time and get all the benefits of working with a company with a highly-structured process. 
1) Live daily calls with PM, we keep Trello board up to date to visualize the progress. No charge for PM.
2) QA engineers are regularly rotated, to ensure fresh opinions on use cases and more bugs discovered. No charge for QA.
3) Weekly design reviews to achieve pixel-perfect results. No charge for design reviews.
4) Constant code reviews are done by our Team Leads to ensure that the code under the hood is scalable, easy to read or maintain, and that it meets our internal quality standards. 
5) All our management staff (like PMs) permanently take UX courses and lectures so we are up to date with all the trends and best practices with everything we do. Your success is our success.
6) We have our own and running marketplace apps, so we know the way the cookie crumbles.
